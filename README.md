# Kurocado Studio Daily UI

A daily design and development challenge where we create modern, functional UIs using Figma for
design, and implement them in both React and Vue, powered by the
[Kurocado Design System](https://github.com/Kurocado-Studio/design-system). It is meant to sharpen
our UI/UX design skills in Figma and stay hands-on with modern frontend frameworks by translating
designs into functional components using both React and Vue.

## Tech Stack

- **Design**: Figma
- **Frontend**: React + Vue 3
- **Design System**:
  [Kurocado Studio Design System](https://github.com/Kurocado-Studio/design-system)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS (as per the design system)

Each UI will have:

- A Figma design (linked or embedded)
- A React version
- A Vue version

## Goals

- Improve consistency between design and development
- Learn and apply the Kurocado Studio Design System
- Compare implementation experiences between React and Vue
- Build a growing portfolio of UI components

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kurocado-Studio/daily-ui.git
cd daily-ui
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Run locally

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

## Components

Each UI component is added day-by-day and may include forms, cards, dashboards, modals, and more â€”
each with matching design and code.

## Notes

- All designs are original or inspired by prompts from the
  [Daily UI challenge](https://www.dailyui.co/).
- Design tokens and components follow the Kurocado Design System for consistency and scalability.

# Kurocado Studio Design System

A tokenâ€‘driven UI library whose look & feel can be tweaked in Figma andâ€”via Token Studioâ€”propagated
to React components, guaranteeing pixelâ€‘perfect brand consistency without handâ€‘off friction.

Kurocado Studioâ€™s Design System delivers a single source of truth for typography, color, spacing,
and interaction patterns across web and mobile products. Designers iterate visually in Figma; Token
Studio syncs the updated design tokens to the codebase, and Storybook reflects the changes
instantlyâ€”so product teams ship new features faster while staying perfectly onâ€‘brand.
